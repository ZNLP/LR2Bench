However, since Tobias brings French Apple Cake, Fiona brings Creme Brulee.\n    Case 2: Fiona Brought Shrimp Ceviche\n        This scenario leads to a contradiction with Clue 3 because Shrimp Ceviche would then be brought by Fiona, not Tobias or the Creme Brulee bringer.\n        Conclusion: Case 2 is invalid.\n\n\nFinal Answer:\nFiona:\n    Main Dish: Gado Gado\n    Dessert: Creme Brulee\nTobias:\n    Main Dish: Shrimp Ceviche\n    Dessert: French Apple Cake\nLeanne:\n    Main Dish: Beef Wellington\n    Dessert: Raspberry Tiramisu\n\n\nFinal Answer in JSON Format:\n<Answer>\n[\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Fiona\",\n        \"main dishes\": \"Gado Gado\",\n        \"desserts\": \"Creme Brulee\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Tobias\",\n        \"main dishes\": \"Shrimp Ceviche\",\n        \"desserts\": \"French Apple Cake\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Leanne\",\n        \"main dishes\": \"Beef Wellington\",\n        \"desserts\": \"Raspberry Tiramisu\",\n    }\n]\n</Answer>\n\nExample Puzzle 2:\n\nHere is a logic puzzle:\n{\n    \"variables\": {\n        \"names\": [\n            \"Max\",\n            \"Kylie\",\n            \"Emma\"\n        ],\n        \"ages\": [\n            \"3 years\",\n            \"4 years\",\n            \"5 years\"\n        ],\n        \"toys\": [\n            \"Train\",\n            \"Dinosaur\",\n            \"Plush Dog\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"clues\": {\n        \"1\": \"Max, the youngest of the three, does not have a plush dog toy.\",\n        \"2\": \"Kylie was comforted by her dinosaur toy.\",\n        \"3\": \"The 4 year old was not dropped off with a plush dog toy.\"\n    }\n}\n\nPlease complete the following blank based on your final solution:\n[\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Max\",\n        \"ages\": \"____\",\n        \"toys\": \"____\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Kylie\",\n        \"ages\": \"____\",\n        \"toys\": \"____\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Emma\",\n        \"ages\": \"____\",\n        \"toys\": \"____\"\n    },\n]\n\nSolution 2:\n\nLet's start solving the logic puzzle step by step.\n\n\nParticipants and Attributes\nNames: Max, Kylie, Emma\nAges: 3 years, 4 years, 5 years\nToys: Train, Dinosaur, Plush Dog\n\n\n\nDetermining Max's Age and Toy:\n    Clue 1 states that Max is the youngest, so Max is 3 years old.\n    Max does not have the Plush Dog toy.\n    Toys available: Train, Dinosaur.\n    Clue 2 indicates that Kylie has the Dinosaur toy, so Max must have the Train.\n\nAssigning Kylie's Attributes:\n    Clue 2 states that Kylie has the Dinosaur toy.\n    Ages available: 4 years, 5 years.\n    Clue 3 indicates that the 4-year-old does not have the Plush Dog.\n    If Kylie were 5 years old, Emma would have to be 4 years old with the Plush Dog, which contradicts Clue 3.\n    Therefore, Kylie must be 4 years old.\n\nAssigning Emma's Attributes:\n    Remaining age: 5 years.\n    Remaining toy: Plush Dog.\n\n    \nFinal Answer:\nMax is 3 years old and has a Train toy.\nKylie is 4 years old and has a Dinosaur toy.\nEmma is 5 years old and has a Plush Dog toy.\n\n\nFinal Answer in JSON Format:\n<Answer>\n[\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Max\",\n        \"ages\": \"3 years\",\n        \"toys\": \"Train\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Kylie\",\n        \"ages\": \"4 years\",\n        \"toys\": \"Dinosaur\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"names\": \"Emma\",\n        \"ages\": \"5 years\",\n        \"toys\": \"Plush Dog\"\n    },\n]\n</Answer>\n\nNow please solve the following puzzle:\n\n<example>\n\nPlease solve the Logic Puzzle according to the provided rules.
