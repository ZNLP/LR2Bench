However, since 1 is already in the first column, this cell must be 2.\nCell (1,4): The only possible number left in row 1 is 1.\nCell (2,2): The possible numbers here are 1 and 3. Given that 3 is already in column 2, this cell must be 1.\nCell (2,3): The only remaining number for this cell in row 2 is 3.\nCell (3,2): The possible numbers here are 2 and 4. Given that 2 is already in column 2, this cell must be 4.\nCell (3,3): The only possible number left here is 2.\nCell (4,1): The only possible number left in row 4 and column 1 is 3.\nCell (4,4): The only remaining number for this cell in row 4 and column 4 is 4.\n\nStep 3: Fill in the Grid\nHere is the final answer:\n<Answer>\n[[2, 3, 4, 1],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [1, 4, 2, 3],\n [3, 2, 1, 4]]\n</Answer>\n\nExample Puzzle 2:\n\nHere is a 4 x 4 sudoku puzzle:\n[[2, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nSolution 2:\n\nLet's start solving the sudoku puzzle step by step.\n\nStep1: Analyze Empty Cell in Row 1\nCell (1,2):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in row), 4 (already in column)\n    Possible Numbers: 1, 3\nCell (1,3):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in row), 3 (already in column)\n    Possible Numbers: 1, 4\nCell (1,4):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in row), 1 (already in column), 3 (already in subgrid)\n    Only possible number: 4\n\nDeduction:\nCell (1,4) must be 4.\nCell (1,3) cannot be 4, so it must be 1.\nCell (1,2) cannot be 1, so it must be 3.\nRow 1: 2 3 1 4\n\nGrid:\n[[2, 3, 1, 4],\n [0, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nStep 2: Analyze Empty Cell in Row 2\nCell (2,1):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in column), 3 (already in row)\n    Possible Numbers: 1, 4\nCell (2,2):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in subgrid), 3, 4 (already in column)\n    Only possible number: 1\nCell (2,4):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 3, 4 (already in subgrid)\n    Only possible number: 2\n\nDeduction:\nCell (2,2) must be 1.\nCell (2,4) must be 2.\nCell (2,1) cannot be 1, so it must be 4.\nRow 2: 4 1 3 2\n\nGrid:\n[[2, 3, 1, 4],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [0, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nStep 3: Analyze Empty Cell in Row 3\nCell (3,1):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 2, 4 (already in column)\n    Possible Numbers: 1, 3\nCell (3,3):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 3 (already in column), 4 (already in row)\n    Only possible number: 2\nCell (3,4):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 2, 4 (already in column)\n    Only possible number: 3\n\nDeduction:\nCell (3,3) must be 2.\nCell (3,4) must be 3.\nCell (3,1) cannot be 3, so it must be 1.\nRow 3: 1 4 2 3\n\nGrid:\n[[2, 3, 1, 4],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [1, 4, 2, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nStep 4: Analyze Empty Cell in Row 4\nCell (4,1):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 2, 4 (already in column)\n    Only possible number: 3\nCell (4,2):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 3, 4 (already in column)\n    Only possible number: 2\nCell (4,3):\n    Eliminated Numbers: 1, 2, 3 (already in column)\n    Only possible number: 4\nRow 4: 3 2 4 1\n\nGrid:\n[[2, 3, 1, 4],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [1, 4, 2, 3],\n [3, 2, 4, 1]]\n\nStep 5: Final Answer\n<Answer>\n[[2, 3, 1, 4],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [1, 4, 2, 3],\n [3, 2, 4, 1]]\n</Answer>\n\nNow please solve the following puzzle:\n\n<example>\n\nPlease solve the Sudoku Puzzle according to the provided rules.
